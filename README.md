# Machine Learning Applications in Tissue Engineering (MLATE)

In this repository, we provide a subset of applications of AI in tissue engineering. In MLATE V1, we predicted cell responses for cardiac tissue engineering. In MLATE V2, we implemented a wide range of supervised and unsupervised algorithms for predicting the quality of 3D (bio)printed scaffolds.

You can read our papers using the following links. We would be more than happy if you cite our works if you use our codes and datasets.
