MLATE is the name of a series of ML-based predictive models that are developed for tissue engineering. 

You will need Python on your PC to use our models. If you don't have Python, follow https://python.org and download it based on your operating system. 


In the first step clone the repository and go to V1 folder, then you should input your material compositions, cell lines and fabrication method to ```bash input.xlsx ```  file. then simply run ```bash prediction.py ``` file.
